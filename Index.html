 < <h1>Spring Break</h1>
   <p>Today is the first day of spring. So as You all know spring break is coming. There is only one week left for spring break. So i will wish you all happy spring break</p>
  <h2>Vanilla HTML</h2>
  <p>this text right here is vanilla HTML. HTML is used for the basic structure of the page, and for text that isn't going to change</p>
  <h2>CSS because why not</h2>
  <div class='awesome'><p>CSS is used to change how the HTML is displayed by the browser. This text has been modified to be even uglier using css</p></div>
  <h2>JS because ridiculous</h2>
  <p>Javascript let's you make things change with time. You can use javascript to change both the HTML and the css. You can make things change with time based on what the user does, like click on something. Or you can make things change with time just because, like here. Let's take this to the next level and make something truly garish using JS</p>
  <div class='zombie'>Work Hard!!Play Hard!!</div>
